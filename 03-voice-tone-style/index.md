### My Voice
#### Sarcastic 
Iâ€™m really into sarcasm and dark humor, so this can be seen in my speech. Psychologists say that this is a sign of passive aggression, but for me it is more like a love language. If I make jokes on you, it means I like you! 
#### Creative
In my native language, Russian, I really love creating new words by mixing up existing ones or inventing unusual declensions for them. My experiments usually end with all my friends repeating my words in conversation. 
### My Tone 
#### Mysterious
Some of my friends, even after many years, say that I am very mysterious person. And they never quite know what's going on inside my head.
#### Structured
I love complete and structured messages, not when you been bombarded with one word messages at a time.
