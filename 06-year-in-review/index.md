### “A year in five minutes”
As the title says, this year has flown by very quickly for me. But a lot has changed this year. I’ve been worried about submitting my bachelor’s thesis for a very long time, and now it’s finally had happened. Do I feel satisfied? - Not really.

Over this year, I have become much calmer and more tolerant of the events around me. School responsibilities, first of all, taught me - patience. And doing things regardless of whether you like them or not. This may sound a little depressing, but I see the benefit in it. After all, I won’t always have projects that I will be satisfied with for 100%. 

As for my personal life, everything is still great. At work, now I do not only the graphic design, but also I do translate applications into other languages. For example, such as Russian, Spanish and French. 

I'm really glad that even with all the stress from school and work, I kept going to the gym. Sometimes I felt too exhausted to even get out of my bed, but I still made it to the gym. By the middle of the year, I had a personal small goal - to do at least 1 pull-up without any assistance. Now I can do 5, so it's safe to say that I've achieved my goal.

Future plans... hm... Well, at least, I would like to finally finish the school and get my diploma. I'm not sure yet if I'll continue my studies and pursue a master’s degree, but now my loved ones are making fun of me, asking if I want to continue. ☻

Overall, this year was great, but I already want it to end soon (speaking of school)
