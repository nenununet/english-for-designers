The game "Imaginarium" is an extension of a popular board game, but with a cool ocean theme. It is a visual game, specially designed to use your imagination for 100%. The goal is not just to have fun and use your imagination but also to learn more about your friends. 
The cards have colorful pictures of things like underwater life, landscapes, and ocean stuff. Each game round takes about 30 minutes.
The game can be replayed as many times as you want

Mainly, I position myself as a graphic designer, but in order not to get bogged down in endless wireframes, I sometimes draw custom tattoos and illustrations.
